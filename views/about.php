                NurtureLife is a web-based software solution aimed at enhancing the quality of maternity care
                in Sri Lanka. The system focuses on improving the monitoring and management of antenatal
                and postnatal mothers by digitalizing mother and child cards.
                Maternal care in Sri Lanka faces several challenges, including insufficient prenatal and
                unestablished postnatal care, inefficient healthcare accessibility, and a call for enhanced
                midwifery services. Additionally, there is a demand for digitizing Mother-Baby Cards,
                establishing a centralized database, streamlining child vaccination procedures, addressing
                newborn nutrition deficiencies, improving communication, and bolstering individualized data
                collection and reporting mechanisms.
                Even though there are systems to generate reports based on aggregated data collection, Sri
                Lanka still does not have a system to collect individual maternal data.
                Currently, maternity care processes in Sri Lanka heavily rely on manual paperwork and
                fragmented information systems. These obsolete methods lead to data redundancy and
                inefficiencies which challenges in providing comprehensive and timely care.
                Our solution will facilitate appointment management, and improve communication channels
                between mothers, Public Health Midwives (PHMs).
                By developing a fully automated maternity care management system, we aim to streamline
                existing processes, facilitate accurate data collection, and create a centralized database system.
